    <h1>Poetry and music that reaches across the digital void</h1>
    <p>Hey, everybody, I'm Elle Cordova. If I look familiar to you, it's probably because at some point, you scrolled across one of my many goofy videos about fonts or AI or the planets or whatever. One of the nerdy sundries I've put out there. I am a literature person by trade and by training, but I love to nerd out about science, and one of the questions that keeps me up at night is: What happened before the Big Bang? So I wrote a poem about it with an assist from science communicator Hank Green, who was talking about that very topic. And he sort of said in passing this line, which really struck me as simple but powerful. So I expanded it into this poem. Here it is.

        Before the Big Bang, there was no up, there was no down, there was no side to side, there was no light, there was no dark, nor shape 
        of any kind, there were no stars or planet Mars, or protons to collide, there was no up, there was no down, there was no side to 
        side, and furthermore, to underscore this total lacking state, there was no here, there was no here because there was no space, and 
        in this endless void which can not be thought of as a place, there was no time, and so no passing minutes, hours, days, of all the 
        paradoxes, that belabor common sense, I think this ones the greatest, this time before events, because how did we get from nothing, 
        to infinitely dense from immeasurably small, to inconceivably immense? but before we get unmoored from the question at the start, 
        let's take a breath and marvel, at when ma                    ause we don't have to comprehend it, to know there was a time, 
        when there was no up, there was no                                  side to side Before the Big Bang there was no up there 
        was no down there was no side to                                         ide there was no light there was no dark nor shape of 
        any kind there were no stars                                                 anetMars or protons to collide there was no up there 
        was no down there was no                                                        side and furthermore underscore this total 
        lacking state there was                                                             here there was no here because there was no 
        space and in this end                                                                 void which cant be thought of as a place

        the paradoxes that                                                                       belabor common sense I think this ones
