            <p>I read all the materials thoroughly on Canvas for week 10, which gave me some clue about what I was doing. (They all very good staff, but totally new to me)</p>

            <p>First, using the in-class pictures as a reference, I replicated the circuit.</p>

            <div class="video">

            </div>

            <p>Then, I wanted to change the LED’s luminance by rotating the potentiometer.</p>

            <p>I added an LED and resistor to the breadboard, but it failed many times. The LED either did not light up or stayed at the same brightness.</p>

            </div>

            <p>Finally, it worked(last 10 seconds). Such a productive holiday!!! But I realized I’m kind of off-topic, PWM seems to be next week’s assignment. OMG, I want to cry.😭😭😭</p>

            <h3>02_Let the LED blink without delay</h2>

            <div class="video">

            </div>

            <p>I learned how to make a LED blink without delay from arduinodocs. It was quite simple and didn’t take much time, since it only required a few components.</p>

             <h3>03_Use button to control LED blink</h2>

            <div class="video">
                <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kz6w6pOVZyA?si=Q8R1t3jX9x3bH24N" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            </div>

            <p>At first, the LED didn’t blink, probably because the tactile switch button wasn’t connected correctly, even though I had connected the corners of the button.</p>

            <div class="video">
                <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/k7JXesxOmlE?si=49xhKeUInABVbcBK" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            </div>

            <p>So I moved the button and placed it across the ravine on the breadboard to give it more pin holes for proper connection. Then I rearranged the other parts of the circuit. Fortunately, it worked, and I was able to control the LED’s blinking by pressing the button.</p>
