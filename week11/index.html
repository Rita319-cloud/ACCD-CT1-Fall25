            <p>I read all the materials thoroughly on Canvas for week 10, which gave me some clue about what I was doing. (They all very good staff, but totally new to me)</p>

            <p>First, using the in-class pictures as a reference, I replicated the circuit.</p>

            <div class="video">

            <p>Then, I wanted to change the LED’s luminance by rotating the potentiometer.</p>

            <p>I added an LED and resistor to the breadboard, but it failed many times. The LED either did not light up or stayed at the same brightness.</p>

            <p>Finally, it worked(last 10 seconds). Such a productive holiday!!! But I realized I’m kind of off-topic, PWM seems to be next week’s assignment. OMG, I want to cry.😭😭😭</p>
