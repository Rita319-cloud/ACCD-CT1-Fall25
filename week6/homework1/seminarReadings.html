    <p class="serif">The fundamental problem with this approach is that static design tools like Illustrator and Sketch fail at prototyping digital systems…… Is google.com a good website because of the look of the search field?……There is a century-long bond between the field of design and new advances in technology, and if graphic designers do not become fluent in this new digital reality, they will become irrelevant. We now have the ability to write code that produces beautiful designs, and the designer of tomorrow will have to understand how to deliver on that promise.<sup>1</sup>
    </p>

    <p class="sans-serif">This paragraph really resonates with me. Most design tools related to graphic design is “what you see is what you get.” On one hand, it gives designers without much technical background a strong sense of control. On the other hand, it weakens the influence of graphic designers. A product or design that is only visually appealing is powerless, user experience, interaction, and other factors are equally essential. Just like google.com is a good website not just because of the look of the search field. If graphic designers can go further, gain more technical and coding knowledge, and consider long-term planning and business impact in their work, they can become far more influential.

    <p class="serif">Second, code enables designers to do things they couldn't do before. Variations of a design can be tested much faster during the prototyping phase, and randomization can be used to reveal designs that the designer would never have created with a pencil. Third, it enables designers to create dynamic systems that can change their designs based on time, place, or use. Throwing a design over the wall for production is a bad legacy of the printed page, and there is no reason for the design process to end with the birth of a product.<sup>2</sup>

    <p class="sans-serif">The reason I returned to college is to have new input and figure out what I can do in the next decade. I often come across reels about TouchDesigner and VR, the visuals look almost magical, and I want to create something really cool. For example, Vision Pro’s new interaction gesture, where flipping your hand reveals interfaces and buttons, or the amazing interplay between the physical and digital worlds in Nintendo’s Labo Kit (where a cardboard piano interacts delightfully with the Switch by using sensors, reflective stickers, and some very simple materials). These wonderful products fill me with excitement about technology and its possibilities when combined with design. Although coding has so far brought me more frustration than joy, as the author of Processing said, “For now, we have to decide to feel comfortable with not knowing everything all at once.”

    <p class="serif">“Meta-design is much more difficult than design; it is easier to draw something than to explain how to draw it. One of the problems is that different sets of potential specifications cannot easily be envisioned all at once. Another is that a computer has to be told absolutely everything. However, once we have successfully explained how to draw something in a sufficiently general manner, the same explanation will work for related shapes, in different circumstances; so the time spent in formulating a precise explanation turns out to be worth it..” Donald Knuth (1986), The Metafont Book<sup>3</sup>
    </p>

    <p class="sans-serif">This is exactly how I feel about creative technology. I might spend just 20 minutes creating a visual effect in PS or AE, but an entire afternoon coding the same result, and there are often bugs. Still, it’s absolutely worth it. I can now see the differences and connections between HTML, JavaScript, CSS, Processing, and Arduino. That’s real progress. Slow is fast.

    <p class="serif">In fact, these three prototypes were developed almost in parallel. They were built by different design team members during the early stages of the project…… Making separate prototypes enabled specific design questions to be addressed with as much clarity as possible…… It was more efficient to wait on the results of independent investigations in the key areas of role, look and feel and implementation than to try to build a monolithic prototype that integrated all features from the start…… This set of three prototypes from the same project shows how a design problem can be simultaneously approached from multiple points of view. Design questions of role, look and feel, and implementation were explored concurrently by the team with the three separate prototypes. The purpose of the model is to make it easier to develop and subsequently communicate about this kind of prototyping strategy.<sup>4</sup>
    </p>

    <p class="sans-serif">At first, I was surprised to see three prototypes being developed simultaneously. Shouldn’t it be done in sequence? But then I realized I’ve already been using the same approach at work. A mature product never prototypes all features at once, and even a new product built from scratch doesn’t. One of the wonderful things about being back in school is that it helps structure and name the knowledge I’ve already practiced, also deepening my understanding.
    </p>

    <p class="serif">To make the prototype, user interface elements were hand-drawn and scanned in. Transitions between steps in the scenario were made interactive in Macromedia Director. This kind of portrayal of onscreen interface elements as rough and hand-drawn was used in order to focus design discussion on the overall features of a design rather than on specific details of look and feel or implementation (Wong, 1992). Ironically, while the design team understood the meaning of the hand-drawn graphics, other members of the organization became enamored with the sketchy style to the extent that they considered using it in the final artifact. This result was entirely at odds with the original reasons for making a rough-looking prototype. This example shows how the effectiveness of some kinds of prototypes may be limited to a specific kind of audience.<sup>5</sup>
    </p>

    <p class="sans-serif">I couldn’t help laughing when I saw this. It perfectly captures how difficult it is to align stakeholders and team members when discussing design and visuals. Why don’t creative teams have the authority to make these decisions?
    </p>

     <p class="serif">The model shown in Figure 1 represents a three-dimensional space which corresponds to important aspects of the design of an interactive artifact. We define the dimensions of the model as role; look and feel; and implementation. Each dimension corresponds to a class of questions which are salient to the design of any interactive system. “Role” refers to questions about the function that an artifact serves in a user’s life—the way in which it is useful to them. “Look and feel” denotes questions about the concrete sensory experience of using an artifact—what the user looks at, feels and hears while using it. “Implementation” refers to questions about the techniques and components through which an artifact performs its function—the “nuts and bolts” of how it actually works. The triangle is drawn askew to emphasize that no one dimension is inherently more important than any other.<sup>6</sup>
    </p>

    <p class="sans-serif">This is very helpful for the direction I want to explore. As a graphic designer and illustrator, I’ve already spent years focused on role and look-and-feel. Now it’s time to work on the third dimension: implementation.
