            <p>I want to use a Mini 2-Axis Analog Thumbstick to control the position of a circle instead of a potentiometer. I thought it would look really cool if the circle could follow the direction of the thumbstick and move around the screen.</p>

            <p>While building the circuit, I realized how crowded everything became, I definitely need a longer breadboard! It took some time to arrange the components, and the thumbstick legs didn’t fit the breadboard very well, so they kept falling out.</p>

            </div>

            <p>The potentiometer (which controls the circle’s size) and the button (which changes the background color) work perfectly, but the thumbstick does not. Right now, I can only move the circle up and down, not left and right, don’t even mention let it fully follow the thumbstick’s movement.</p>
