            <p>First, I want to make a Christmas tree. Pressing each button will generate a triangle along with the sound. After we have 3 triangles, I want to generate the glitch effect by rotating the potentiometer. The glitch effect and sound will respond to the change of data.</p>

            </div>

            <p>However, it didn't work. I thought this was a simple effect. But there was always a ghost glitch in the right corner of the canvas.</p>

            </div>

            <p>Then, I changed the visuals. Instead of pixel tree and glitch, pressing each button would generate a different tree along with the sound. After 4 trees generated on the screen, you could click each tree and add some colorful bulb. Click tree also triggers the sound as well.</p>
